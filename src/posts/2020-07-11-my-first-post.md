It took years, but I've finally made a website. 


Actually, this must have been the eleventh website I made, but nonetheless it seems a like a new start.  I'm making the time to post here often and I swear it won't be about just code.


Why?

Mostly, I dislike Social Media. I use Twitter, yes, but my audience there is mostly coders and hustlers who may not be interested in my day-to-day activities or thoughts, so why bother them? Besides, having a personal blog is cool. 

So 2003. Therefore cool.

Hope you'll stick around and read more about my thoughts on here. Thank you.
