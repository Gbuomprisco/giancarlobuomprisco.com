After almost 9 years, I've decided to leave London and the UK.

Blaming the pandemic for this decision is easy, but there are prior and maybe more important factors that led to this decision.

### From Pisa to London

I moved to London in 2011 when I was still a student in Pisa, thanks to the Erasmus program, that granted EU students the ability to move to another country and study for a semester.

It was a much more difficult move I had expected, in part because my English skills were much poorer than I thought. Secondly, because London was so very, very expensive.

Afterwards I had the possibility to work at KCL as an intern, a job that then became a fixed-term contract. As a 21-year-old not yet graduated, this was unreal. 

You don't get possibilities like this everywhere, but in London everything is possible - which is also what makes it so special.

### The early days in London and why I miss them

When I arrived in London, the vibe around the Old Street/Shoreditch area was unbelievably energetic. The coffee shops, coworking spaces, pubs: you could see people coding anywhere, anytime. 

The motivation and inspiration I gained from just being able to be around people with similar passions and values is still one of my best memories about the city.

I had the pleasure to work in one of the first WeWork in the city. Despite what you think about the company itself, I can never forget the time spent in there, with loads of companies working on the coolest products in town, and the brightest minds a few chairs away.

New companies were growing: I still remember the Monzo (remember Mondo?) launch party, when it was still a small startup. It was exciting to see, even just as a spectator.

### The beginning of the end

It all started around the time of the Brexit vote: a feeling of gloominess suddenly hit the city. The day after the Brexit vote was still one of the weirdest days I remember of my time in London. Most people I talked to were dumbfounded.

It was the first time I started thinking about leaving the city, but it wasn't the right time: London has still too much to offer. 

I would become a contractor only months later, and I started working for some of the best financial companies in London: SocGen and Barclays, where I helped write financial software used by thousands of traders every day to move unbelievable sums of money. 

It was a dream come true. 

Although working in finance is not as exuberant as you may think, it was probably the time I grew the most as a software developer. It was the first time I had architectural responsibilities, and my decisions had never been as impactful for the product I was building. 

Not to mention, the domain was both the hardest and the most challenging piece of work I have had to deal with. It wasn't just about writing the technology, but also understanding the logic and the finance behind the product. 

Admittedly, to this day I am still very bad at it.


### What's next?

After spending months by myself in my flat in London finishing my last contract, I decided to apply for a Taiwan Gold Visa to rejoin my girlfriend in Taipei.

Goodbye, London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.

See you soon, Taipei ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼
