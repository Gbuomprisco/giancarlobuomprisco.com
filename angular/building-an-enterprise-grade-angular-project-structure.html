All projects will always use the latest version of the code</li><li>A <em>microfrontend</em> allows large applications to be split into smaller apps in their own codebase, maybe using a totally different stack, that can be composed. For example, your login page could be written in <em>Vue</em> and the rest of the app in <em>Angular</em> and <em>React</em>. It is worth mentioning that <em>Nx Workspaces</em> also allow using different technology stacks, such as <em>React</em></li></ul><blockquote><p>💡 You may want to take a look at <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnx.dev%2Fgetting-started%2Fgetting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nx Workspace</a>s</p></blockquote><p>Building an Angular project as a <em>monorepo</em> containing more projects and libraries is an appealing solution, but practically difficult to undertake for massive technology companies, where many teams and projects are separate and far away from each other.</p><p>So where should be libraries built?</p><ul><li>If all developers of a company are set to work on the same main project, no matter how large, a monorepo could be a good solution</li><li>If instead developers are set to work on different projects, in different teams, locations, and more importantly codebases, you may want to build each library in their own repository</li></ul><h2>Typescript entities</h2><p>If you are using Angular with Typescript — and I assume you are, you also have to take into account Typescript’s own powerful entities that we can leverage to make a structured, well-written codebase.</p><p>Here is a list of Typescript entities that you’ll be using the most in your project:</p><ul><li>classes</li><li>enums</li><li>interfaces (and types)</li></ul><p>I like to group these entities in their own folder within a module, which I reluctantly call <em>core,</em> but this is very much up to you and your team to decide.</p><p>I recommend creating a matching Typescript file for each back-end entity. This includes enums, DTOs (for both requests and responses), and data classes.</p><p><img class=" shadow-lg my-4 rounded-lg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*RlTkHY3DfZo7bMrWI6eHgA.png" loading="lazy"/></p><p>Sometimes, for example, we are going to be developing against a microservice shared by several teams within a company. In similar cases, I think it makes sense to build an angular library that will be hosting the matching classes, interfaces, and enums rather than developing the module locally.</p><h2>State Management</h2><p>Whatever state management library you’re planning on using, one thing I’d recommend is to keep the business logic separated from domain modules. We can leverage the <em>Service Modules</em> pattern  and import it in its relative feature module.</p><p>A State Management service module only needs to export two things:</p><ul><li>the module itself in order to register its providers</li><li>a facade service that acts as a bridge between the UI components of our feature module and the store</li></ul><p>What advantages does this pattern have?</p><ul><li>if we import the module from a lazy loaded route — this will be imported only when the route is loaded. Sometimes, you may need multiple feature modules in a specific route — in which case you may be forced to import them from <em>AppModule</em> as well</li><li>Better separation/encapsulation from the UI. The components don’t need to know what state-management you’re using</li><li>We can refactor/change the state-management </li></ul><p>I like to keep the state separate from feature modules, which is a practice particularly popular but that still keeps the Angular community fairly divided:</p><ul><li>let’s say we have a routed module called <em>Dashboard</em> at root level  that contained all its UI components </li><li>again at root level — we have a folder called <em>store</em> that contains all the state service modules that will handle the state</li></ul><h3>NGRX programming entities</h3><p>What programming entities does NGRX have?</p><ul><li>reducers</li><li>actions</li><li>selectors</li><li>effects (from @ngrx/effects)</li><li>adapter (from @ngrx/entity)</li></ul><p>Let’s look at a brief example in the image below using NGRX, which I will be explaining in detail in a separate article.</p><p><img class=" shadow-lg my-4 rounded-lg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*XAewyZhX58E-BmuSFxi2dw.png" loading="lazy"/></p><ul><li>The dashboard module imports the dashboard store module</li><li>The components within the <em>dashboard</em> module will only communicate with the store through the service <em>DashboardFacadeService</em></li></ul><blockquote><p>💡 If we create a test for each file we create, it&#x27;s a good idea to place them in a separate folder</p></blockquote><h2>Takeaways ⭐</h2><ul><li>One of the first things to think about when setting up a new project, regardless of which stack you’re using, is to think about the programming entities you are going to use</li><li>Some modules that are highly-reusable should probably live outside of your main app: leverage Angular libraries 💪</li><li>Think about splitting your feature modules from their state by creating state-management service modules</li></ul></div></article><div class="max-w-2xl mx-auto"></div><div class="w-full md:w-8/12 mx-auto"><script async="" data-uid="3e3126f064" src="https://thoughtful-inventor-7842.ck.page/3e3126f064/index.js"></script></div><div><hr class="border-accent-2 mt-16 mb-14"/><h3 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-center font-semibold my-4 md:my-12 flex flex-row space-x-4 items-center justify-center"><span>More Posts for</span> <div class="text-center flex flex-row space-x-1 items-center cursor-pointer collection--angular" href="/angular"><img class="object-contain" loading="lazy" style="width:28px;height:28px" src="/assets/images/collections/angular.png" alt="angular"/><span class="hover:underline">Angular</span></div></h3><section><div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 md:gap-x-12 lg:gap-x-16 gap-y-20 md:gap-y-24 mb-32"><div><div class="mb-3"><div class="sm:mx-0"><a aria-label="Benchmarking Angular 12 with Webpack 5" href="/angular/webpack-5-angular12"><img style="width:100%;height:auto" class="shadow-small block hover:shadow-medium transition-shadow duration-200" src="/assets/images/posts/benchmarking-webpack-5.webp" alt="Cover Image for Benchmarking Angular 12 with Webpack 5" loading="lazy"/></a></div></div><h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 leading-snug"><a class="hover:underline" href="/angular/webpack-5-angular12">Benchmarking Angular 12 with Webpack 5</a></h3><div class="text-xs mb-2 flex flex-row space-x-2 items-center"><div class="text-gray-600"><time dateTime="2021-05-14T00:00:00.322Z">May	14, 2021</time></div><span class="text-gray-600">·</span><span class="text-gray-600">2 min read</span><span class="text-gray-600">·</span><div class="text-xs"><div class="text-center flex flex-row space-x-1 items-center cursor-pointer collection--angular" href="/angular"><img class="object-contain" loading="lazy" style="width:16px;height:16px" src="/assets/images/collections/angular.png" alt="angular"/><span class="hover:underline">Angular</span></div></div></div><p class="leading-relaxed mb-4 text-sm">Angular 12 has been released and with it the much awaited Webpack 5 upgrade.

All projects will always use the latest version of the code\n*   A _microfrontend_ allows large applications to be split into smaller apps in their own codebase, maybe using a totally different stack, that can be composed. For example, your login page could be written in _Vue_ and the rest of the app in _Angular_ and _React_. It is worth mentioning that _Nx Workspaces_ also allow using different technology stacks, such as _React_\n\n\u003e 💡 You may want to take a look at [Nx Workspace](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnx.dev%2Fgetting-started%2Fgetting-started)s\n\nBuilding an Angular project as a _monorepo_ containing more projects and libraries is an appealing solution, but practically difficult to undertake for massive technology companies, where many teams and projects are separate and far away from each other.\n\nSo where should be libraries built?\n\n*   If all developers of a company are set to work on the same main project, no matter how large, a monorepo could be a good solution\n*   If instead developers are set to work on different projects, in different teams, locations, and more importantly codebases, you may want to build each library in their own repository\n\n## Typescript entities\n\nIf you are using Angular with Typescript — and I assume you are, you also have to take into account Typescript’s own powerful entities that we can leverage to make a structured, well-written codebase.\n\nHere is a list of Typescript entities that you’ll be using the most in your project:\n\n*   classes\n*   enums\n*   interfaces (and types)\n\nI like to group these entities in their own folder within a module, which I reluctantly call _core,_ but this is very much up to you and your team to decide.\n\nI recommend creating a matching Typescript file for each back-end entity. This includes enums, DTOs (for both requests and responses), and data classes.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*RlTkHY3DfZo7bMrWI6eHgA.png)\n\nSometimes, for example, we are going to be developing against a microservice shared by several teams within a company. In similar cases, I think it makes sense to build an angular library that will be hosting the matching classes, interfaces, and enums rather than developing the module locally.\n\n## State Management\n\nWhatever state management library you’re planning on using, one thing I’d recommend is to keep the business logic separated from domain modules. We can leverage the _Service Modules_ pattern  and import it in its relative feature module.\n\nA State Management service module only needs to export two things:\n\n*   the module itself in order to register its providers\n*   a facade service that acts as a bridge between the UI components of our feature module and the store\n\nWhat advantages does this pattern have?\n\n*   if we import the module from a lazy loaded route — this will be imported only when the route is loaded. Sometimes, you may need multiple feature modules in a specific route — in which case you may be forced to import them from _AppModule_ as well\n*   Better separation/encapsulation from the UI. The components don’t need to know what state-management you’re using\n*   We can refactor/change the state-management \n\nI like to keep the state separate from feature modules, which is a practice particularly popular but that still keeps the Angular community fairly divided:\n\n*   let’s say we have a routed module called _Dashboard_ at root level  that contained all its UI components \n*   again at root level — we have a folder called _store_ that contains all the state service modules that will handle the state\n\n### NGRX programming entities\n\nWhat programming entities does NGRX have?\n- reducers\n- actions\n- selectors\n- effects (from @ngrx/effects)\n- adapter (from @ngrx/entity)\n\nLet’s look at a brief example in the image below using NGRX, which I will be explaining in detail in a separate article.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*XAewyZhX58E-BmuSFxi2dw.png)\n\n*   The dashboard module imports the dashboard store module\n*   The components within the _dashboard_ module will only communicate with the store through the service _DashboardFacadeService_\n\n\n\u003e 💡 If we create a test for each file we create, it's a good idea to place them in a separate folder\n\n## Takeaways ⭐\n\n*   One of the first things to think about when setting up a new project, regardless of which stack you’re using, is to think about the programming entities you are going to use\n*   Some modules that are highly-reusable should probably live outside of your main app: leverage Angular libraries 💪\n*   Think about splitting your feature modules from their state by creating state-management service modules\n"},"content":{"compiledSource":"var u=Object.defineProperty,h=Object.defineProperties;var d=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors;var n=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols;var r=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,l=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var s=(e,t,a)=\u003et in e?u(e,t,{enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0,value:a}):e[t]=a,i=(e,t)=\u003e{for(var a in t||(t={}))r.call(t,a)\u0026\u0026s(e,a,t[a]);if(n)for(var a of n(t))l.call(t,a)\u0026\u0026s(e,a,t[a]);return e},m=(e,t)=\u003eh(e,d(t));var p=(e,t)=\u003e{var a={};for(var o in e)r.call(e,o)\u0026\u0026t.indexOf(o)\u003c0\u0026\u0026(a[o]=e[o]);if(e!=null\u0026\u0026n)for(var o of n(e))t.indexOf(o)\u003c0\u0026\u0026l.call(e,o)\u0026\u0026(a[o]=e[o]);return a};const layoutProps={},MDXLayout=\"wrapper\";function MDXContent(a){var o=a,{components:e}=o,t=p(o,[\"components\"]);return mdx(MDXLayout,m(i(i({},layoutProps),t),{components:e,mdxType:\"MDXLayout\"}),mdx(\"p\",null,\"An important task in setting up a modern front-end project is to define a scalable, long-term and future-proof folders structure, and the naming guidelines for each different programming entity.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"While some think of this as a simple and secondary aspect\\u200A\\u2014\\u200Ait often hides more complexities than it seems.
