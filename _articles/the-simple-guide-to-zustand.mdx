The title of this post may be misleading. It's not a "simple guide" because
we're explaining a concept that needs dumbing down, it's simple because
**[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) is a complete, yet
super-simple state management library**.

Zustand was built to offer an alternative to the boilerplate and the
complexity of existing state-management solutions, such as React's `Context API`
and `Redux`.

As a long-time ngRx user, I was longing for a much simpler (and quicker) way
to manage state in my applications. *Zustand* has been a simpler answer to
my needs.

In this guide, I want to describe how to get started with Zustand, go
through some key aspects, and answer some questions I had when
working with it.

While primarily seen and known as a state-management for React, it's worth
mentioning that Zustand is a decoupled library and can work without it just
fine.

## Getting Started with Zustand

As usual, you will need to install Zustand using NPM:

```
npm i zustand --save
```
