Page speed and UX have become critical SEO metrics that Google, and other search engines, use for ranking pages. 

SEO-aside, **serving fast-loading pages is fundamental** for delivering your content to low-powered devices or users with poor connections (especially as the two factors usually go hand-in-hand).

As a blogger myself, I strive to deliver fast-loading pages and rich and interactive. 

Here's the issue: combining the two can get hard.

This blog sometimes provides coding snippets with CodeSandbox, an excellent online IDE you may be familiar with: I use an `iframe` so that I can embed the content of the page right on my blog posts. 

Of course, loading a whole new React app, tracking scripts, etc., will be costly. We're talking about MBs. So then, what can we do? 

In this blog post, I want to show you how I wrote a React component that uses the Intersection Observer API to load snippets using hefty content (such as CodeSandbox snippets) only when the user scrolls near one of them.

Lazy loading content on your blog or website will result in a faster and better experience for your users and most likely **better Core Vitals**, which generally result in a **better SEO ranking** for your posts.

You can also use this component for deferring the loading of computationally heavy React components, such as Charts or long lists, for **boosting the runtime performance of your React applications**.

We will name this component `LazyRender`. Let's start.

## Building the Lazy Render component

This component will work in this way:

```tsx
<LazyRender>
  <CodeSandboxSnippet src={src} />
</LazyRender>
```

The `LazyRender` component will render its tree when the `observer` notifies us that the element intersects according to the options we passed.

We allow consumers to pass three properties:
- `rootMargin`: a string that specifies the vertical and horizontal margins that we can define to control when we are notified: if we use `-200px 0px`, the observer notifies when the user scrolls 200px above or below the target component
- `threshold`: a numeric property that serves as the threshold after which the Intersection Observer will notify the element is intersecting. For example, if we use `1`, then we will be notified after all the component is visible on the screen
- `onVisible`: a simple callback that the component calls when becoming visible

```tsx
const LazyRender: React.FC<{
  threshold?: number;
  rootMargin?: string;
  onVisible?: () => void
}> = ({ 
  children, 
  threshold, 
  rootMargin, 
  onVisible 
}) => {
```

Because we need the HTML element wrapper to register an Intersection Observer listener, 
we define a React reference `ref`, which we will assign to a `div` element as a wrapper for the children of this component.

Furthermore, we define a `visible` state to trigger a re-rendering when the component becomes visible.

```tsx
const ref = useMemo(() => 
  createRef<HTMLDivElement>(), []);

const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = 
  useState(false);
```

Now, we're going to use a `useLayoutEffect` hook to run after the first rendering of our component; this is because we need to get the Intersection Observer to observe the element rendered.

```tsx
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  // shouldn't happen but makes TS happy
  if (!ref.current) {
    return;
  }

  const options = {
    rootMargin: rootMargin ?? "0px",
    threshold: threshold ?? 1,
  };

  const observer = 
    new IntersectionObserver((entries, observer) => {
      entries.forEach((entry) => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
          setIsVisible(true);
          observer.disconnect();

          if (onVisible) {
            onVisible();
          }
        }
      });
    }, options);

  observer.observe(ref.current);

  // clean up when the component is unmounted
  return () => {
    observer.disconnect();
  };
}, [threshold, rootMargin, ref, onVisible]);
```

What's happened above?
- we created an `Intersection Observer` observer instance and observed the element referenced by `ref` (which we will assign in the render function)
- when `entry.isIntersecting` is equal to `true`, we set the variable `isVisible` to `true`, which will re-render the component, and this time will also render the `children` tree
- we also tear down the observer's listener and call the `onVisible` callback if provided by the consumer

Finally, we return the function to render the component:

```tsx
return <div ref={ref}>{isVisible ? children : null}</div>;
```

### SSR

If you're using SSR, you may receive an error because React will not run the `useLayoutEffect` hook on the server.

It makes sense to prevent these errors by only wrapping the `LazyRender` component within another component, which will render the tree only if running in the browser.

To do that, we create a new component `ClientOnly`:

```tsx
function isBrowser() {
  return typeof window !== 'undefined';
}

const ClientOnly: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
  return isBrowser() ? <>{children}</> : null;
};

export default ClientOnly;
```

Whenever we use the `LazyRender` component, we can combine it with `ClientOnly` or add it to the component render function itself.

```tsx
<ClientOnly>
  <LazyRender>
    <CodeSandboxSnippet />
  </LazyRender>
</ClientOnly>
```

## CodeSandbox Demo

Of course, here is the CodeSandbox snippet, obviously lazy-loaded! Scroll to the bottom to see the lazy loaded component. After you scroll down, you can see that our text changed from `Not visible yet` to `Visible`.

You will find the complete snippet's source code by clicking on the link or you can find it below:

### Full source code

```tsx
import { 
  createRef, 
  useLayoutEffect, 
  useMemo, 
  useState 
} from "react";

const LazyRender: React.FC<{
  threshold?: number;
  rootMargin?: string;
  onVisible?: () => void;
}> = ({ children, threshold, rootMargin, onVisible }) => {
  const ref = useMemo(() => 
    createRef<HTMLDivElement>(), []);

  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = 
    useState(false);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    if (!ref.current) {
      return;
    }

    const options = {
      rootMargin: rootMargin ?? "0px",
      threshold: threshold ?? 1
    };

    const observer = 
      new IntersectionObserver((entries, observer) => {
      entries.forEach((entry) => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
          setIsVisible(true);
          observer.disconnect();

          if (onVisible) {
            onVisible();
          }
        }
      });
    }, options);

    observer.observe(ref.current);

    return () => {
      observer.disconnect();
    };
  }, [threshold, rootMargin, ref, onVisible]);

  return <div ref={ref}>{isVisible ? children : null}</div>;
};

export default LazyRender;
```

## Final Words

The component implemented in this blog post is super-simple; you may need to tweak it to consider more scenarios in more complex situations.

For easier use-cases, like in my case, this should more than be sufficient to leverage the fantastic Intersection Observer API.

The local Lighthouse test **recorded a score 3 points higher with lazy-loading**. 

Still, you **may expect even more significant differences** with Google's PageSpeed Insights (a more realistic test for speed, where you'll usually hit a lower score). 

I'd say this is enough reason to start implementing this or any other component with similar functionality to improve loading performance, website SEO, and ultimately your users' experience.

If you also use Angular, you may be interested in [the blog post I created to do the same with an Angular directive](/angular/intersection-observer-with-angular). The code in the Angular example also waits for an amount of time before re-rendering so that we can skip useless renderings when the user scrolls past an element.

To the next one, ciao!
