Template Literal Types are one of the best things to happen to TS in a long time. They allow us to generate dynamic code - and also provide the correct types to the consumers. 

This new ability is particularly handy to library creators: imagine automatically creating typed Redux actions based on the prefix of the entity of a reducer, for example.

## Subjects and State

I like RxJs' Behavior Subjects for storing state - it's easy and quick. 

Though there is a ton of repetition - I've always tried to find a way to reduce the boilerplate needed.

Let's see a quick example with an Angular component (the code below is very meta-codey, don't take it too literally):

```typescript
enum State {
    Initial,
    Loading,
    Success,
    Error
}

class MyComponent {
    readonly state$ = 
        new BehaviorSubject<State>(State.Initial);

    readonly states = State;

    requestData() {
        this.state.next(State.Loading);

        return this.http.pipe(
            tap(() => 
                this.state.next(State.Success);
            ),
            catchError((e) => {
                this.state.next(State.Error);
                console.error(e);

                return of([]);
            })
        )
    }
}
````

```html
<ng-container [ngSwitch]="state$ | async">
    <ng-container *ngSwitchCase="state.Initial">
        <button (click)="requestData()">
            Request Data
        </button> 
    </ng-container>

    <ng-container *ngSwitchCase="state.Success">
        All good!
    </ng-container>

    <ng-container *ngSwitchCase="state.Error">
        Ooops!
    </ng-container>

    <ng-container *ngSwitchCase="state.Loading">
        Loading...
    </ng-container>
</ng-container>
```

Template Literal Types finally allow us to do so. Enter Reactive Enum. Even if you're not interested in using it, learning what's possible with using Template Literal Types is eye-opening.

## Reactive Enum

Our goal is: given a TS enum, generate an Rx `Observable` for each key, so that we can subscribe to each key's value changes.

Here is an example:

```typescript
// declare an enum
enum Status {
  Initial,
  Pending,
  Success,
  Error
}

// pass your enum to "reactiveEnum"
const status = reactiveEnum(Status);

// "status" has now autmatically generated a method for each value of the enum
status.initial$.subscribe(); // false ...  // true
status.pending$.subscribe(); // false      // ^
status.success$.subscribe(); // false      // |
status.error$.subscribe();   // false      // |
                                           // |
status.set(Status.Initial);                // |
status.value$(); // Observable<Status.Initial>
```

I happen to simplyfing my templates by writing lots of methods that check if the current state is a certain value of the enum. That is, lots of mapping `enum === EnumValue`.

Let's compare the above with the same code if we were to use a `BehaviorSubject`:

```typescript
import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';

class MyComponent {
  private readonly status$ =
    new BehaviorSubject<Status>(Status.Initial);
  
  private readonly initial$ =
     this.status$.pipe(map(status => status === Status.Initial));
  
  private readonly pending$ = 
    this.status$.pipe(map(status => status === Status.Pending));

  // and so on
}
```

When we use the `reactiveEnum` utility, these methods are already there!

### Building it from scratch

Okay! Let's see how we can build the above.

First, let's define the types which we can assign to each key of a reactive enum.

Our reactive enum will contain the following methods:

- all the keys generated using the enum, appended with the dollar sign `$`
- a few utility methods to set the current value, reset to the original value, unsubscribe, etc.

```typescript
import { BehaviorSubject, Observable, map } from 'rxjs';

interface CurrentState<S> {
  value$: Observable<S[keyof S]>;

  value(): S[keyof S];
}

interface Settable<S> {
  set(value: S[keyof S]): void;
}

interface Resettable {
  reset(): void;
}

interface Releasable {
  release(): void;
}

type KeysToObservableMapper<State> = {
  readonly [K in Extract<keyof State,
    string> as `${Lowercase<K>}$`]: Observable<boolean>;
};

export type ReactiveEnum<S> = KeysToObservableMapper<S> &
  Settable<S> &
  CurrentState<S> &
  Resettable &
  Releasable;

type Enum<E> = Record<keyof E, E[keyof E]>;

interface Transition<State> {
  when: Observable<unknown>;
  become: State[keyof State];
}

interface Config<State> {
  initialValue?: State[keyof State];
}

type ConfigParam<State> = State[keyof State] | Config<State>;
```

The magic happens here:

```typescript
type KeysToObservableMapper<State> = {
  readonly [K in Extract<keyof State,
    string> as `${Lowercase<K>}$`]: Observable<boolean>;
};
```

What's going on here? Let's see:

- we create a Type named `KeysToObservableMapper` which takes an argument `State`, and has the shape of an object
- we iterate the keys of the argument `State` by using `K in {}`, but we use `Extract` to only get the strings of this type
- we then map K using the `as` syntax, transform `K` to its lowercase value, and append `$` at the end of the literal type
- the value of each key is indeed `Observable<boolean>`

### Code generation

Now that our types are in check - we need to write the code that generates the methods dynamically.

Our `reactiveEnum` will accept the enum, and we will use the second parameter for setting the initial value. We leave the interface flexible by allowing a full configuration objec.

```typescript
function reactiveEnum<State extends Enum<State>>(
  state: State,
  config: ConfigParam<State> = {},
): ReactiveEnum<State> {
  const initialValue = isConfigObject<State>(config)
    ? (config as Config<State>).initialValue
    : config;

  const state$ = 
    new BehaviorSubject<State | undefined>(initialValue);

  const container: Partial<ReactiveEnum<State>>
     = {};

  for (const key in state) {
    const property = `${key.toLowerCase()}$`;

    const value$ = state$.pipe(
        map((value) => {
            return value === state[key];
        }),
    );

    Object.assign(container, {
      [property]: value$,
    });
  }

  Object.assign(container, {
    set: (value: State) => state$.next(value),
    reset: () => state$.next(initialValue),
    release: () => state$.unsubscribe(),
    value$: state$.asObservable(),
    value: () => state$.getValue(),
  });

  return container as ReactiveEnum<State>;
}

function isConfigObject<T>(
    config: ConfigParam<T>
): config is Config<T> {
  return Object(config) === config;
}
```

What happens here?

- First, we create a subject with an initial value
- For each property, we define a set of methods attached to an object `container`
- Each key of the property needs to match the type of our literal type defined in the interface, hence will be `${key.toLowerCase()}$`
- Once we set the utility methods (release, reset, set, etc.), we return the object to the consumer

## Tests

Let's write a simple test to check the initial value is set up correctly:

```typescript
enum Status {
  Initial,
  Loading,
}

describe(`reactiveEnum`, () => {
    it('should start with a default value', (done) => {
        const status = reactiveEnum(Status, {
            initialValue: Status.Initial,
        });

        const streams$ = combineLatest([
            status.loading$,
            status.initial$,
        ]);

        streams$.subscribe(([loading, initial]) => {
            expect(loading).toBe(false);
            expect(initial).toBe(true);

            done();
        });
    });
});
```

## Limitations

This library has some limitations:

- all enum values are converted to its lowercase particularly
- no current way of setting a value without using an enum. This can be very useful in Angular's templates, if we set a value directly from the template - because we would not need to store a public property with the `Enum`

## Using the library

If you're interested in using this library, you can also install it from NPM

Install the library from NPM:

```
npm i @ngbites/reactive-enum
```

## Final Words

This is a very quick example of what TS's template literal types can do, but hopefully can inspire you to do some magic stuff and save you tons of keystrokes.
