excerpt: This post shows how to create a React component to render components conditionally.

JSX allows a lot of freedom for what you can do in your components: at the end of the day, _it's just Javascript_.

If you're like me and you've primarily worked with template-based frameworks (such as Vue or Angular), you may be used to directives or components that take care of the flow: conditions, for-loops, switch, etc.

React doesn't have these baked in (like SolidJS), but we can easily add it.

This blog post will show you the conditional rendering component, which you can use with React, but it is also easily applicable to any other JSX-based library.

One challenge I faced was making sure the result of the condition was correctly cast so that **we could safely use it with Typescript**.

### Let's write the If component

First, we define two type aliases with Typescript:

* `Falsy` which represent values that are falsy in Javascript
* `Condition` which is the value passed to the component

```tsx
type Falsy = undefined | null | 0 | "";
type Condition<Value = unknown> = Value | Falsy;
```

We're going to call the component `If`.

It accepts two properties:

* `condition`: it's _any_ value. If it is truthy, then `children` will be displayed
* `fallback`: it's optional and will be displayed if it's defined, and if it's the condition is `falsy`

Of course, it also accepts a `children` property, which **we augment to take a function**.

Why? Because we want to pass the "casted" value to the children's tree.

For example, if I pass a component `Button` as a condition, I want to be able to use `Button` within the tree because it is not `falsy`.

To do so, `Button` will be passed down casted as a parameter of the function we define in the `children`.

```tsx
type Props = React.PropsWithChildren<{
  condition: Condition<Value>;
  fallback?: ReactNode;
  children: ReactNode | ((value: Value) => ReactNode);
}>

function If<Value = unknown>({
  condition,
  fallback,
  children,
}: Props) {
   // body
}
```

We can now write the body:

* if `condition` is truthy, we can render the `children`. If it's a function, then we call it and passed the result of the condition down as a parameter
* if `condition` is falsy, and the `fallback` property is defined, we render `fallback`
* otherwise, we return `null` so that nothing gets rendered

```tsx
return useMemo(() => {
  if (condition) {
    if (typeof children === "function") {
      return <>{children(condition)}</>;
    }

    return <>{children}</>;
  }

  if (fallback) {
    return <>{fallback}</>;
  }

  return null;
}, [condition, fallback, children]);
```

And here is the complete snippet:

```tsx
type Falsy = undefined | null | 0 | "";
type Condition<Value = unknown> = Value | Falsy;

function If<Value = unknown>({
  condition,
  children,
  fallback
}: React.PropsWithChildren<{
  condition: Condition<Value>;
  children: ReactNode | ((value: Value) => ReactNode);
  fallback?: ReactNode;
}>) {
  return useMemo(() => {
    if (condition) {
      if (typeof children === "function") {
        return <>{children(condition)}</>;
      }

      return <>{children}</>;
    }

    if (fallback) {
      return <>{fallback}</>;
    }

    return null;
  }, [condition, fallback, children]);
}
```
### Example

Let's see a quick example that shows how to use the `If` component:

```tsx
function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<number>(0);

  const onChange = (e: FormEvent<HTMLInputElement>) =>
    setValue(Number(e.currentTarget.value));

  const fallback = <span>Fallback content</span>;

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <div>
        <input value={value} type="number" onChange={onChange} />
      </div>

      <If condition={value} fallback={fallback}>
        Value: {value}
      </If>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Conditionally rendering a component from the props

Another useful case I found is when I pass components as optional props, and conditionally **render the component if the consumer has passed it**.

Let's assume we have a component that accepts another one.

In the ideal world, I could write the following:

```tsx
const ReusableComponent: React.FC<{
  heading?: React.FC;
}> = ({  heading: Heading, children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <If condition={Heading}>
        <Heading />
      </If>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Unfortunately, I (or Typescript) am not smart enough to make the `children` tree understand that `Heading` was casted as truthy.

`Heading` will error-out because the type-checking cannot understand that the `If` tree is only rendered when the condition value is truthy.

So we use a function to pass the casted value:

```tsx
const ReusableComponent: React.FC<{
  heading?: React.FC;
}> = ({  heading, children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <If condition={heading}>
        {(Heading) => <Heading />}
      </If>
    </div>
  );
};
```

I am generally happy with the readability that this offers compared to ternaries, &&, or other weird ways that make Typescript happy.

Of course, let me know if you have any questions or suggestions to improve this!
