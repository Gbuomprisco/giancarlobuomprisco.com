Web3 is a new, revolutionary, and (very) controversial phenomenon, becoming harder and harder to ignore.

Whether you are fascinated by it or not, it's undeniable that its consequences are far-reaching; many developers are re-training to get up to speed with it.

As I started working on a task for requesting users to connect their wallet to retrieve their MetaMask address, I had the opportunity to work with a Web3 wallet for the first time.

## What's a Wallet?

If you do not know what MetaMask is, here is a short explanation: MetaMask is a digital wallet living in your browser as an extension; you can use it to keep, transfer or move various cryptocurrencies and NFTs. 

Furthermore, web3 websites can request to connect with said wallet, and if authorized, perform actions on behalf of the owners. 

For example, you can connect the wallet to OpenSea (or any other marketplace) and buy an NFT, or connect to PancakeSwap to swap tokens with other ones.

## Building the Component

While being a blockchain engineer involves writing custom *smart contracts*, protocols, etc., it's slightly ironic that web3, as revolutionary as claimed, will still be primarily built using web2 technologies. 

That means tons of Javascript (which is a little bit embarrassing to acknowledge when hacks happen due to this fact).

In short: **we still need the good old Javascript** to build on top of web3, so let's see how we can get started with a simple component, which, thanks to the MetaMask wallet, allows us to **request the user's account of choice using the API** exposed by the Chrome extension.

### Extending Window

We need to extend the Window with the MetaMask API as we use Typescript.

The extension exposes an object named `ethereum` which provides the necessary API to interact with the wallet.

We will add the script below globally or within the same Component's file:

```tsx
declare global {
  interface Window {
    ethereum: {
      request<T>(params: { method: string }): Promise<T>;
      on<T>(event: string, cb: (params: T) => void): void;
      removeListener<T>(event: string, cb: (params: T) => void): void;
      selectedAddress: string | undefined;
    };
  }
}
```

### Component Basics

And now we can start writing the component. 

Let's layout a basic `ConnectWalletButton` component:

```tsx
import React from "react";

const ConnectWalletButton: React.FC<{
  onConnect: (address: string | undefined) => void
}> = ({ onConnect }) => {
  // implementation
};

export default ConnectWalletButton;
```

And now we can import it in our `App`:

```tsx
import "./styles.css";
import ConnectWalletButton from "./ConnectWalletButton";

export default function App() {
  const [selectedAddress, setSelectedAddress] = useState<string>();
  
  const addressChanged = useCallback((address: string | undefined) => {
    setSelectedAddress(address);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Connect with MetaMask Demo</h1>

      <ConnectWalletButton onChange={addressChanged} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

We defined a callback to read the address from the button's parent. This is only a good solution if you want to read the address locally, otherwise it would be better to use any state-management tool, like the `Context API` or more complex stuff like Zustand, Redux, etc.

Let's add just enough CSS to make it look good-ish:

```css
button {
  padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem;
  border-radius: 30px;
  font-size: 1rem;
  background-color: #03a9f4;
  color: #fff;
  font-weight: 600;
  border-width: 0;
  cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #039be5;
}

button:active {
  background-color: #0288d1;
}
```

### Using the MetaMask Ethereum API

And now on to the actual logic. 

If you paid attention when we extended `Window`, we have added two methods to the `ethereum` global object (just enough to make this component work because there are a lot more).

- The first method is `request`: by calling it, we can request actions, which in this case will be `eth_requestAccounts`
- The second method is `on`: by calling it, we can listen to specific events, for example, when the wallet's account has changed
- The third method `removeListener` will be used to clean up the callback and avoid memory leaks when the component is unmounted

#### Goals

What will the component do?
- Prompt users to Connect their wallet
- Display the address if connected
- Emit an event with the address when it changes
- Automatically update if the user updates the address or disconnects from MetaMask

#### Implementation

Let's start implementing the goals above. 

First, let's define an async function which lets us request and read the address from MetaMask:

```tsx
async function readAddress() {
  const method = "eth_requestAccounts";

  const accounts = await window.ethereum.request<string[]>({
    method
  });

  // for simplicity, let's return the first account in the list
  return accounts[0];
}
```

We want to store the address' state as it can mutate from the outside. Because the wallet may already be connected when the component mounts, we initialize it with the property `selectedAddress`:


```tsx
const [address, setAddress] = useState<string>(
  window.ethereum.selectedAddress
);
```

Let's define a function which will read and store the address:

```tsx
const connectWallet = async () => {
  const selectedAddress = await readAddress();

  setAddress(selectedAddress);
  onChange(selectedAddress);
};
```

We now need to listen for changes from the extension so that we can update the component according the correct state.

In fact, users can change the current address or disconnect the website using the MetaMask extension:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const eventName = `accountsChanged`;

  const listener = ([selectedAddress]: string[]) => {
    setAddress(selectedAddress);
    onChange(selectedAddress);
  };

  // listen for updates
  window.ethereum.on(eventName, listener);
  
  // clean up on unmount
  return () => {
    window.ethereum.removeListener(eventName, listener);
  };
}, []);
```

What happens here?
- we listen for updates using the `on` method, and update the current address using the first element in the list
- when the component unmounts, we call the `removeListener` method so we can clean everything up

Now, we can finally render our component: 

```tsx
if (address) {
  return <button>Connected with {address}</button>;
}

return <button onClick={connectWallet}>Connect Wallet</button>;
```

## Final Words

I know, I know. Web3 is controversial. 

I have some reservations myself, but with that said, I also feel like it's good to keep an open mind about the technology and how it's shaping up the new tools we're going to use in the future, probably.

I hope to make more posts about this as I dig further into the space. To the next one, ciao!
