**Angular 12** has just been released! Yay!

This is a particularly long-awaited release due to the CLI using Webpack 5 by default, which comes with improved performance and tree-shaking - or at least that's the promise.

That means, faster and smaller builds. Who doesn't like that?

I took the time to benchmark 2 apps I work on, one small and another medium-sized: read on to see the results.

**Notice:**: The results can differ wildly given your setup and applications, so please don't take this benchmarks too seriously.

Actually, I'd love to know what your results will end up being!

### Setup

The tests have been done on a Macbook Pro 2018 i7 2.2Ghz 32Gb RAM - using Node v16.

- The Webpack 4 builds are built using Angular 11.2.12.
- The Webpack 5 builds are built using Angular 12.0.0.

## Webpack 5 vs Webpack 4: Small Application benchmark

### Development Build Time

The following graph shows the results for the **initial** development build time.

- Webpack 4: 30.1 seconds
- Webpack 5: 32.9 seconds

As you can see, the new Webpack version falls behind nearly 3 seconds - which is a bit of a bummer.

### Production Build Time

The following graph shows the results for the production build time. The version 5 makes up for falling behind in the development build.

```bar-chart
Version, Time in Seconds
Webpack 4,58.1
Webpack 5,51.8
```

- Webpack 4: 58.1 seconds
- Webpack 5: 51.8 seconds

I was positively impressed by this one, 7 seconds is pretty noticeable.

### Production Bundle Size

The following graph shows the results for the total production bundle size.

That means, we take into account the total size of all the initial assets (main, styles, polyfills, runtime).

The total size is **not** gzipped.

- Webpack 4: 833.29kb
- Webpack 5: 830.19kb

Webpack 5 wins the production race - although maybe not by as much as we'd all hoped!

## Webpack 5 vs Webpack 4: Large Application benchmark

### Development Build Time

- Webpack 4: 74 seconds
- Webpack 5: 84.5 seconds

10 seconds longer for starting the development build is unfortunately a lot more.

### Production Build Time

The following graph shows the results for the production build time. The version 5 makes up for falling behind in the development build.

- Webpack 4: 1 minute 37 seconds
- Webpack 5: 1 minute 34 seconds

### Production Bundle Size

- Webpack 4: 1.961Mb
- Webpack 5: 1.970Mb
