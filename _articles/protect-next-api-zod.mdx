The first step towards writing security API endpoints with Next.js should be
making sure that the server receives the expected data structure from the
clients.

There are various libraries that help us validate the clients' payloads
reasonably well, such as *Joi* and *class-validator* which I have used
extensively in the past.

The library that impressed me the most lately has been [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod), a great
validation library for working with Typescript written by
[colinhacks](https://twitter.com/colinhacks).

Let's take a look at how we can use Zod for validating the payloads coming
from a client, improving the security of your application, and help you
strong-typing your apps without `as` hacks.

## Getting to Know Zod

### Installing Zod using NPM

You can install Zod using `npm`:

    npm i zod --save

### Basic Usage

Zod allows us to validate any data-type you can think of, such as complex
objects, promises, or simple values.

Thanks to the `z` object imported from `zod`, we can define the expected
schemas.

From the Zod readme:

```tsx
const stringSchema = z.string();
stringSchema.parse("fish"); // => returns "fish"
stringSchema.parse(12); // throws Error('Non-string type: number');
```

If you need to validate more complex objects, then we can use `z.object()`.

This time around, though, you may want to simple return the validation
status instead of throwing an error. You can do so by calling `safeParse`
rather than `parse`:

```tsx
const schema = z.object({
  displayName: z.string(),
  email: z.string().email(),
});

const isValid = z.safeParse(payload); // boolean
```

This is useful if you want to return a custom error.

## Using Zod with Next.js

We can access the client's request in a Next API using the `request
parameter, which is the first argument of an API handler.

The `req.body` object which you receive in your API handler is, for good
reason, typed with `any`. If you access the `body` object without validating
your object, then **you are blindly trusting the client** to return what you'd
expect. As you may well know, this is rarely the case.

As you run Next.js in a serverless environment, any uncaught errors may
cause your API instances to shut down, which **will also increase the amount
of cold starts**.

This is not ideal nor for you, nor for your application's users.

By using Zod, we can safely access the data received or return the correct
error back to the client.

### Validating a Next.js API Endpoint

Let's assume our endpoint is expecting to receive the following interface:

```tsx
interface Body {
  userId: string;

  newOrganization: {
    name: string;
    users: string[];
  }
}
```

The above could easily be represented with the following Zod schema:

```tsx
const schema = z.object({
  userId: z.string().min(1),
  newOrganization: z.object({
    name: z.string().min(1),
    users: z.array(
      z.object({
        email: z.string().email(),
      })
    ).min(1),
  })
});
```

Let's break this down. We expect our payload to receive:

- a string `userId`, which cannot be empty `min(1)`
- an object `newOrganization`, containing:
  - a string `name`, which cannot be empty `min(1)`
  - an array `users`, containing a list of objects:
    - with a property `email` accepting strings with a valid email format

We will now run a few tests against some payloads to see how it behaves.

### Parsing Objects with the Zod schema

It's very important to notice that `Zod` returns a different payload when we
call it with `.safeParse`.

- if we validate payloads with `.parse`, `Zod` will either resolve or throw an
error, which you should make sure to catch in some way

- if we validate payloads with `.safeParse`, `Zod` will return the following
interface:

  ```tsx
  {
    data: T;
    success: true;
  } | {
    success: false;
  }
  ```

What does that mean for you?

If you plan on catching errors and have a good mechanism in place (for
example, using a [middleware](/next/handling-api-errors-in-nextjs)), then
you can use `.parse`:

```tsx
export default function apiHandler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse,
) {
  try {
    const data = schema.parse(req.body);

    // we can safely use data with the shape provided
    console.log(data.organizationId);
  } catch(e) {
    return res.status(400).send({
      message: `Yo, bad payload!`
    });
  }
}
```

<Image
  width={'1192'}
  height={'638'}
  src={'/assets/images/posts/zod-test-1.png'}
/>

As you can see in the image above, the object returned by `parse` **is
correctly inferred by Typescript** as
having the shape we validated. Neat and
powerful ðŸ”¥

If you plan on using `.safeParse`, instead, we don't need to wrap our API
around a `try/catch` block because it won't throw an error.

Instead, we need to check that the response contains `success=true`, which
correctly discriminates the union and means we can safely access our payload.

```tsx
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

export default function apiHandler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse,
) {
  const response = schema.safeParse(req.body);

  if (!response.success) {
    return res.status(400).send({
      message: `Yo, bad payload!`
    });
  }

  console.log(response.data.organizationId) // works, and TS is happy
}
```

### What does a Zod error look like?

When Zod parses the payload nad fails to validate it, it will return us the
reasons why the validation failed.

Let's assume our payload looks like the below. Clearly, it will throw an
error because the array `users` is empty, but we declared we want it to have
a minimum length of `1`:

```tsx
const test = schema.safeParse({
  userId: "123",
  newOrganization: {
    name: "My Organization",
    users: []
  }
});

console.log(`Test 1: expect an error`, JSON.stringify(test, null, 2));
```

This is the payload returned:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "issues": [
      {
        "code": "too_small",
        "minimum": 1,
        "type": "array",
        "inclusive": true,
        "message": "Should have at least 1 items",
        "path": [
          "newOrganization",
          "users"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "name": "ZodError"
  }
}
```

It's not great to expose this data to your clients, so you may not want to
return it straight as is.

## Codesandbox Demo

You can play with Zod using the CodeSandbox snippet below. Please drag the
sidebar on the left-hand side to see the code, and open the console to see
the output, otherwise it will show you a blank screen.

## Final Words

`Zod` isn't the only library that can do this, but has become my favourite one.

`Joi` doesn't play as well with typescript, `class-validator` has always been
kind of weird with arrays and only works using classes with decorators
(which is not what you may be doing).

You can get started using it and read all the validations option it provides
[on Github](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).
