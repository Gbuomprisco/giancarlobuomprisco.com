Next.js API routes are fun, simple and easy. However, they're also a
little bare-bones.

Next API routes are great when you're building on top of it, but it
requires developers to write a lot of additional code to build
functionalities that many take for granted, such as:

- protecting against unsupported methods
- gating access to signed-in users
- any prior set-up that needs to be done before executing the business-logic
of such route

Being used to working with NestJS, a batteries-included back-end framework,
I took a lot for granted. But Next.js does not come with opinions in this
regard, unlike stuff built on top of it such as Blitz.js. Therefore, we'll
have to stitch something up.

Just as an example, let's assume we're writing an API handler using
Firebase that:

- initializes an admin app
- checks that the correct method is being called
- checks a user exists
- responds to the user's request

Normally, you could write something similar:

```tsx
export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse,
) {
  // we only like POST here
  if (req.method !== 'POST') {
    return res.status(405).end();
  }

  // we can initialize the admin now
  await initializeAdminApp(req);

  const user = await getSignedInUser(req.headers);

  // user not logged in, no good here
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(401).end();
  }

  const data = await makeDatabaseRequest();

  return res.send(data);
}
```

Now, nothing wrong with what we've written above!

Nevertheless, it's just a tad repetitive if we think that our application can
have hundreds or more API endpoints. And with repetition there will
certainly be avoidable mistakes.

In case you hadn't noticed: the function above does not handle any error,
which can happen in at least 3 situations. This would considerably increase
the boilerplate code needed, making the function above look way more complex.

A couple of points about the above:
- we don't need to check we're calling the correct method imperatively
- we don't need to manually log the user in imperatively too

The average API route will likely have many more "set-up" steps such as the
above: we need a better solution.

### Enter Next JS pipes

A middleware is a function that receives two parameters: `NextApiRequest`
and `NextApiResponse`, and returns a function to which we will pass these
parameters.

A middleware's job can vary:
- setting up the libraries (such as Firebase Admin)
- connecting to the DB
- hitting a cached result
- authentication
- validation of the body, query, method, etc.
- a lot more use-case you may be aware of

For example, a perfectly valid middleware could be the following function:

```tsx
export default async function authMiddleware(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse,
) {
  return async function (handler: NextApiHandler) {
    try {
      await initializeFirebaseAdminApp();

      return handler(req, res);
    } catch (e) {
      return internalServerErrorException(res);
    }
  };
}
```

With the middleware above, we could wrap a Next.js API route so that the
code in the middleware will be executed before running the body of the API
function.

```tsx
export default authMiddleware(
    async function myRoute(
      req: NextApiRequest,
      res: NextApiResponse
    ) {
      // admin is now initialized!
      // body of the function goes here
    }
);
```

Writing middlewares like the above does feel better as we can now
encapsulate repetitive logic within smaller functions.

The only downside to this is that when we have multiple middlewares, we will
need to wrap them one within the other. It can get long.

One other way is to apply a simple pipe function so that the middlewares get
executed in the same order we define them: the very last function, which
should be the API route, will be the one sending data back to the caller.

The only exception to this is if we send the headers before that: for
example, if we catch an error and want to stop the chain of middlewares, we
should not execute them.

### Middleware Piping

Alright, let's create a function called `withMiddleware`. This function
accepts an undefined number of middlewares, plus the API route which will
send the data back to the caller.

The API route logic should always be placed as the last function.

It's going to look like something similar to the below:

```tsx
export default withMiddleware(
  withAdmin,
  withMethodsGuard(['POST']),
  withAuthedUser,
  myApiHandler,
);

async function myApiHandler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse,
) {
  const data = await getDataFromDb();

  res.send(data);
}
```

Is it just me or this looks a lot better? Hope you agree! :D

Let's see how we can write our chaining function `withMiddleware`:

```tsx
type Handler = (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => unknown;

export function withMiddleware(
  ...functions: Handler[]
) {
  return async function
    (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
      for (const func of functions) {
        if (typeof func === 'function') {
          // return early when the request has
          // been ended by a previous middleware
          if (res.headersSent) {
            return;
          }

          await func(req, res);
        }
      }
    };
}
```

Nothing fancy here, we iterate our function and execute them one by one
using the original `req` and `res` parameters.

If the property `headersSent` is `true`, it means that a previous middleware
has already called `res.send()` or `res.end()`. Therefore, we skip as it
will throw an error.

The good thing of middleware's is that we can combine them as many times as
we like. For example, we know hat to use the authentication library, we also
need to connect to the admin.

```tsx
export const withAuthedUser = withMiddleware(
  withAdmin,
  withUser,
);

export const withAdminGuard = withMiddleware(
  withAuthedUser,
  withRoleGuard(['admin']),
);
```

This code may not be absolutely perfect for production-use, but it shows how
to increase reusability and readability of our API routes with a very simple
piping function.

This is not to be confused with the concept of Next.js Middleware introduced
in Next.js 12, which while they achieve the same thing, thy are limited by
the fact that they're not running on Node (which is also what makes them so
fast).

In our example, we could not use it because Firebase needs to run in
a Node environment.

Do you like this pattern? Do let me know if you have any comment or suggestions!
