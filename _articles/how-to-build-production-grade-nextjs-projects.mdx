**Scenario**: you built an app, and it's time to ship it to your users.
Unfortunately, you have no idea which steps to take before and after
shipping your application to production.

In this article, I want to describe some steps that you should take
to **ship production-grade Next.js projects** to your users.

### The React Framework for Production

Next.js is marketed as "The React Framework
for Production". And for good reason: unlike many other web frameworks,** Next.
js requires little-to-no further optimization** to
be deployed to production.

The Next.js developers have done a commendable job at minimizing the amount of
work required to ship projects that are fast, efficient and fully-functional,
and even more so if deployed with Vercel.

With that
said, **some development practices are universal** and cannot be overlooked;
no framework will fully handle them for you.

We will learn about:
1. Architecture
2. Environment Setup
3. Error Handling
4. Logging
5. Performance Optimization
6. Caching
7. Testing
8. Monitoring

## Architecture

## Environment Setup

As you may know, your environment variables are normally defined in a `.env`
file. As a best practice, you will keep a list of files based on
each environment, such as:

- .env.development
- .env.staging
- .env.production

Next.js is smart enough to figure out which environment variables file to
serve, so we can be sure that the correct environment variables defined in
each of these environments will be correct.

### How does Next.js load your environment variables?

### Storing Private Environment Variables

Storing private variables (API keys, passwords, etc.) requires more attention.

As you should never expose private data, and therefore cannot check this in
with your code, it needs to be injected from a safe location: normally,
these variables are defined in your CI or in your Vercel Console.

Unfortunately, even as a best practice, doing this also presents some other
risks.

### Preventing undefined variables

One of the most common risks when deploying to production is that developers
can forget to define these variables in their CI.

One recommended practice is to always double-check that a mandatory
environment variable is defined at build-time.

By throwing errors when a required variable isn't defined, you can be sure
that your code will fail during the build-phase, rather than at runtime,
when it's too late.

```tsx
if (!process.env.MY_ENV_VARIABLE) {
  throw new Error(
    `Environment variable MY_ENV_VARIABLE was not defined!`
  );
}
```

Or, better, we can define a reusable function to prevent undefined
environment variables:

```tsx
function requireEnvVariable(key: string) {
  const value = process.env[key];

  if (value) {
    return value;
  }

  throw new Error(`Environment variable ${key} was not defined!`);
}

const key = requireEnvVariable('PRIVATE_KEY');
```

In this way, you can be sure that a deployment will fail if one of the
required environment variables have not been defined. Of course, you should
also check that these are correct.

## Error Handling

Any proper production-grade application should be **resilient to runtime
exceptions**.

When building a new app, it's easy to overlook
error-handling, as we're focused on writing as many features as possible in a
short timeframe: this is justified if you're getting to market fast
or if you are a small team/solo-developer.

Depending on your needs, you can choose to defer error-handling to shortly
after having shipped your MVP (besides marketing, of course).

Eventually, if your business is going anywhere, it will need to be resilient
to errors, exceptions and unexpected behavior.

### Handling Fetch Errors

### Setting up a 404 and 500 error pages

The first and simplest step is to define the pages for when your users are
met with 400 or 500 HTTP exceptions.

Next.js makes it easy: just define two new pages in the `pages` folder:

- **Not found exceptions**: create the page `pages/404.tsx`
- **Server exceptions**: create the page `pages/500.tsx`

While not a strict requirement, it's certainly a good practice not to show
an empty page to your users.

### Validating Payloads

Use Zod

## Logging

Logging may deserve a whole blog post by itself. Logging helps you debug and
understand what happens when your users use your application. Logging can be
used to debug exceptions, performance issues, etc.

Logging can be done on both client and server sides, but in this post we only
introduce server-side logging.

### Use Sentry

[Sentry](https://sentry.io) is a *SaaS* for logging, tracing and managing
exceptions in both your
client-side application and your API.

It's my go-to solution, although you
can also use other providers such as Bugsnag.

Sentry offers a generous free plan with 5k events per month, which should be
more than enough to get started with.

I am not paid to advertise Sentry; I genuinely think using it is a
no-brainer.

The only downside to using it is that its SDK is very large, and as such,
will increase the size of your JS bundles: not ideal. There are some ways to
work it around; lazy loading the JS SDK, for example, or using a thinner SDK
that doesn't make use of all its features.

### Use Pino

Pino is a lightweight logging library by the creators of *Fastify*.

## Performance Optimization

## Caching

### Caching Assets

### Caching API Responses

#### Stale While Revalidate

### Use Redis

## Smoke Testing and E2E

Software engineers with a strict and rigourous technical mindset will
rage-close this page and go for a walk to calm down after reading this, but
hear me out.

Developers who are rushing out their application to market (yes, there can be
good reasons for this) would make a terrible mistake writing a full test
suite before the first release.

Unless you're part of an enterprise project or
an extremely well-funded startup, chances are that velocity to ship is of the
utmost importance to your venture.

If you don't yet have a *real* business, it doesn't matter how many tests you
have; without product-market fit, your application will ultimately fail.

So, is it that wrong to write E2E tests before releasing? No, not exactly.
Let me explain.

E2E testing for startups and solo-developers should cover **the most important
features of
your business**; the critical parts that, if
broken, would absolutely cancel any value proposition your application offers.

Building a 100% tested codebase is the perfect recipe to spend way long not
making a real business; but, writing smoke tests for your app's critical parts
is an
effective way to **ship a production-grade application that solves your users'
problems, and that lets you sleep better at night**.

What parts of a business are critical?
- **Authentication**: if your users can't sign in or up, there's not much
they can do with your application. Yes, test authentication thoroughly.

- **Billing and Payments**: while services like Paddle and Stripe help us
with most of the heavy-lifting, wiring these services up is still a decent
amount of work that needs to be taken very seriously. There's no doubt that
anything related to financial services needs testing.

- **Your value proposition**: I don't know what this is, but you do.

### Cypress

## Monitoring
