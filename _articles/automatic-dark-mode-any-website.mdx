CSS is magic.

No, seriously. I recently incorporated Cal.com's embed in one of my websites for booking appointments. 

The iframe's content looks great, with one downside: my website has a dark theme, and Cal.com's dark themes are only on paid plans (which I'm hoping to upgrade to as soon as I can).

But, in the meantime, I had to find a way to style the `iframe` content to blend seamlessly with my page's theme. 

As you may already know, styling iframes is a pain - hence why so many third parties use them so that the host's styles won't interfere with the embedded content.

To solve this, I found a CSS one-liner that inverts all the colors, resulting in a theme that would probably blow my manual changes out of the water. 

In all honesty, I didn't randomly try this, but I'm sure I read this somewhere on Twitter some time ago, which I recalled (though I wasn't sure it would have worked for content within the iframe).

### Using CSS Filter's to invert your page's colors

For example, if you want to add a dark theme to your whole page, you can use the following rule:

```css
html {
  filter: invert(1);
}
```

And magic! All the page's colors are inverted. In some cases, the results are spectacular.

If you wanted to use it on an `iframe` so that you could apply the dark theme to the content within, add the CSS to the iframe's element:

```html
<iframe style='filter: invert(1);' src='https://anexternalservice.com/' />
```

If you are using Tailwind CSS, you could add the class `dark:invert`, which inverts the colors only if the selected theme is `dark`:

```html
<iframe class='dark:invert' src='https://anexternalservice.com/' />
```

### Demo

Try it on this page! Click the button below:

<button 
  style={{
    'borderColor': '#000',
    'borderWidth': '2px',
  }}
  className='py-2 px-4'
  onClick={() => document.firstElementChild.style.filter = document.firstElementChild.style.filter === 'invert(100%)' ? '' : 'invert(100%)'}
>
  Click here to toggle Dark Theme
</button>

### Not Bullet-Proof

Of course, this is a simple approach for simple problems. In my specific case, in which I had nearly no control, it worked great! 

However, more complex pages may not look as well as you expect. For example, look at the author image above for a simple demonstration. 

My recommendation is to use this when: 
- you need to style elements you have no control over
- styling simple, individual parts of the page you want to `darkify` automagically

Hopefully, you'll find this as helpful as I did! Ciao!
