It's that time of the year! Dry January, when we put down the beer and try
to embrace a healthier lifestyle. Well, at least that has been me for my
whole adult life.

I've always been a bit chubby: not fat, definitely not lean. And putting the
fat off has seemed
like an unreachable feat, until, four years ago a new gym near my flat in
London started advertising their new opening, at only £16 a month.

Considering that most gyms in my area cost north of £100, I felt like it was
an offer I couldn't refuse. This time, I would do it the right way.

Fast-forward to today, the 2-year lockdown totally killed my gains. What it
didn't kill, though, is the knowledge that came with them, and the optimism
that achieving your health goals isn't as hard as you think.

As I restart embarking on my health journey, I want to share my tips for
becoming a healthier developer.

My tips regard improving you diet, starting exercising, and suggestions to
make the process as easy as possible.

## Diet

It all starts from here. A correct and balanced diet is the single biggest
change you can do to become healthier. Without a better diet, all the other
efforts could become worthless.

Assuming a correct diet means understanding, even at a high level, the
macronutrients of the food we consume.

Mind you, I am no PhD: I try to consume information at a practical level. I
cannot go into detail of things I do no full understand, but I can use the
advice from experts and apply in a balanced way.

Ultimately, this post isn't to become the next Mister Olimpya: it's to feel
better, and what I do to achieve it.

## Exercise

## Sleep
