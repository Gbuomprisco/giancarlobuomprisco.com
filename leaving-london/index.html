Secondly, because London was so very, very expensive.</p><p>Afterwards I had the possibility to work at KCL as an intern, a job that then became a fixed-term contract. As a 21-year-old not yet graduated, this was unreal.</p><p>You don't get possibilities like this everywhere, but in London everything is possible - which is also what makes it so special.</p><h3>The early days in London and why I miss them</h3><p>When I arrived in London, the vibe around the Old Street/Shoreditch area was unbelievably energetic. The coffee shops, coworking spaces, pubs: you could see people coding anywhere, anytime.</p><p>The motivation and inspiration I gained from just being able to be around people with similar passions and values is still one of my best memories about the city.</p><p>I had the pleasure to work in one of the first WeWork in the city. Despite what you think about the company itself, I can never forget the time spent in there, with loads of companies working on the coolest products in town, and the brightest minds a few chairs away.</p><p>New companies were growing: I still remember the Monzo (remember Mondo?) launch party, when it was still a small startup. It was exciting to see, even just as a spectator.</p><h3>The beginning of the end</h3><p>It all started around the time of the Brexit vote: a feeling of gloominess suddenly hit the city. The day after the Brexit vote was still one of the weirdest days I remember of my time in London. Most people I talked to were dumbfounded.</p><p>It was the first time I started thinking about leaving the city, but it wasn't the right time: London has still too much to offer.</p><p>I would become a contractor only months later, and I started working for some of the best financial companies in London: SocGen and Barclays, where I helped write financial software used by thousands of traders every day to move unbelievable sums of money.</p><p>It was a dream come true.</p><p>Although working in finance is not as exuberant as you may think, it was probably the time I grew the most as a software developer. It was the first time I had architectural responsibilities, and my decisions had never been as impactful for the product I was building.</p><p>Not to mention, the domain was both the hardest and the most challenging piece of work I have had to deal with. It wasn't just about writing the technology, but also understanding the logic and the finance behind the product.</p><p>Admittedly, to this day I am still very bad at it.</p><h3>What's next?</h3><p>After spending months by myself in my flat in London finishing my last contract, I decided to apply for a Taiwan Gold Visa to rejoin my girlfriend in Taipei.</p><p>Goodbye, London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.</p><p>See you soon, Taipei ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼</p></section></article></div></div><script async="" src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-172445743-1"></script><script>function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[],gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","UA-172445743-1")</script><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Martel:wght@400;700;800&amp;display=swap" rel="stylesheet"><script>!function(){if("loading"in HTMLImageElement.prototype){var e=document.querySelectorAll("img"),t=e.length;if(0<t)for(var s=0;s<t;s++)"dataset"in e[s]&&"src"in e[s].dataset&&(e[s].src=e[s].dataset.src),"srcset"in e[s].dataset&&(e[s].srcset=e[s].dataset.srcset)}else{var a=document.createElement("script");a.async=!0,a.src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lazysizes@5/lazysizes.min.js",document.body.appendChild(a)}}()</script></body></html>
