This means that the component will be always checked. Not efficient, right?</p>\n<p>Why do that, if most components did not need to get updated? Enter <code>ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush</code>, which will instruct the change detection to skip a component except when any of the following situations happens:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Input reference of the component changes</li>\n<li>DOM Event within a component has been dispatched (ex. click)</li>\n<li>Emission of an observable event subscribed with Async pipe</li>\n<li>change detection is manually run</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This practice is even more important for large and complex applications as the amount of components skipped by the change detection is substantial. A simple way to see the differences between the two approaches is to use Chrome's rendering dev tools. Check the \"Paint flashing\" option and see for yourself how many times your components are needlessly re-rendered.</p>\n<p>In the following example, our component will <em>not</em> be updating the view:</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token decorator\"><span class=\"token at operator\">@</span><span class=\"token function\">Component</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token operator\">...</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  template<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'{{ count }}'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  changeDetection<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> ChangeDetectionStrategy<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>OnPush\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">ChangeDetectionComponent</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">implements</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">OnInit</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  count <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token function\">ngOnInit</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">setInterval</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token operator\">++</span><span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>count<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">1000</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<h3>RxJS to the rescue</h3>\n<p>Developers coming from Angular 1.x may finding this confusing and difficult to use: admittedly, using OnPush without RxJS is not always easy.</p>\n<p>With that said, I like to argue that using OnPush offers a way for better coding practices. For example, by promoting the usage of RxJS and the <code>async</code> pipe, we get a predictable and declarative codebase which also happens to be super-performant.</p>\n<p>Here are some advantages to using the <code>async</code> pipe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>automatically subscribes to observables</li>\n<li>automatically unsubscribes when the component gets destroyed</li>\n<li>effortless cooperation with ChangeStrategyStrategy.OnPush</li>\n<li>reduced LOC in our components</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, RxJS + OnPush = win-win.</p>\n<p>Let's refactor the previous example using an <code>Observable</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token decorator\"><span class=\"token at operator\">@</span><span class=\"token function\">Component</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token operator\">...</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  template<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'{{ count$ | async }}'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  changeDetection<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> ChangeDetectionStrategy<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>OnPush\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">ChangeDetectionComponent</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">implements</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">OnInit</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  count$<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> Observable<span class=\"token operator\">&#x3C;</span><span class=\"token builtin\">number</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token function\">ngOnInit</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>count$ <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">interval</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">1000</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">pipe</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n            <span class=\"token function\">map</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>count<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">number</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token operator\">++</span>count<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>We now have an elegant, declarative and performant solution!</p>\n<h3>NGRX</h3>\n<p>When dealing with a large-scale application, I would suggest to use a state-management library. Not only because it helps manage state, but also because Angular state management libraries treat Observables as first-class citizens, just like the framework does. While there's a bunch of great libraries out there, I highly recommend NGRX.</p>\n<p>NGRX makes working with pure Angular components effortlessly by using RxJS for pulling data from the store, which means all the data held in components are observables.</p>\n<p>If you don't know NGRX yet, then you should probably you give it a read.</p>\n<p>In order to read the following example, all you need to know is that we're retrieveing data from the store (think of it as our database) as an observable, and that we're displaying it in our template by subscribing via the <code>async</code> pipe.</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token decorator\"><span class=\"token at operator\">@</span><span class=\"token function\">Component</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token operator\">...</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    changeDetection<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> ChangeDetectionStrategy<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>OnPush<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    template<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token template-string\"><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span><span class=\"token string\"></span>\n<span class=\"token string\">        &#x3C;div *ngFor=\"let todo of (todos$ | async)\"></span>\n<span class=\"token string\">            {{ todo.name }}</span>\n<span class=\"token string\">        &#x3C;/div></span>\n<span class=\"token string\">    </span><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span></span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">TodosComponent</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">constructor</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">private</span> store<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> Store<span class=\"token operator\">&#x3C;</span>AppState<span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token function\">ngOnInit</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>todos$ <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>store<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">select</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>state<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> state<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>todos<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The framework will render the template every time <code>todos$</code> emits a new value.</p>\n<h3>When does not <em>not</em> make sense to use OnPush?</h3>\n<p>Never! OnPush is a simple way for making your applications <em>way</em> faster, and personally see no reasons for not using it every time.</p>\n<h2>Refactoring a codebase for performance ðŸš€</h2>\n<p>Most legacy Angular codebases I worked with were all using the default change detection, and the performance of the application was highly affected by that. Most developers were also not keen on the idea of using it, simply because it seems intimidating at first. But, well, it doesn't have to be.</p>\n<p>The first thing to know if you are planning on refactoring a codebase by also using the OnPush change detection, is that you never start from the parent components. The reason is, when changeDetection is added to a parent component, as a result all its components tree will be affected.</p>\n<p>My recommendation is to start from the leaves and working your way up to the parent components. Dumb components, if written well, shouldn't normally be affected because they simply receive inputs and render it, so they're the first you should be refactoring.\nOnce all the tree of a container has been refactored, it's time for the container.</p>\n<p>What's the container responsible for?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Retreieving the data and passing it down to other components</li>\n<li>Putting together the layout of 1 or more components</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Managing the data is arguably the most difficult task front-end developers face today, which is why well-designed containers are key to the overall architecture of a project.</p>\n<p>I recommend two alternatives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>use your own RxJS state management by using Subjects within services, and exposing data via Observables, if you don't feel like using third parties</li>\n<li>Use NGRX, NGXS, Akita, etc.?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <code>OnPush</code> change detection strategy, your app will be faster</li>\n<li>Use <code>async</code> pipe, it will make <code>OnPush</code> easier to work with</li>\n<li>Use a state management library, alternatively leverage RxJS within your services</li>\n<li>Refactoring is hard(ish): start from your leaves components and work your way up until all components use <code>OnPush</code></li>\n</ul>\n","coverImage":"https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/960/288/1*VKY-Ldkt-iHobItql7G_5w.png","collection":"angular"},"morePosts":[{"readingTime":"3 min read","title":"Benchmarking Angular 12 with Webpack 5","date":"2021-05-14T00:00:00.322Z","slug":"webpack-5-angular12","coverImage":"/assets/images/posts/benchmarking-webpack-5.png","collection":"angular","excerpt":"Angular 12 has been released and with it the much awaited Webpack 5 upgrade.
