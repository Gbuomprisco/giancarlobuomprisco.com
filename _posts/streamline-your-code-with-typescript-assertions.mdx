title: Streamline your code with Typescript assertions
excerpt: In this post we introduce Typescript assertions, which can make our Typescript code easier to read and more concise by not introducing conditions

Typescript assertions allow us to write defensive code without sacrificing legibility or code organization, such as wrapping code blocks into conditions, etc.

Typescript developers often resort to type guards for telling the compiler the correct types, but this has a downside: the right type will be inferred only within the condition.

Let's use a type guard to check if an HTMLElement query is not null:

```typescript
function assertElementExists(
  element: HTMLElement | null
): element is HTMLElement {
  if (!element) {
    throw new Error(`Element was not found`);
  }
}

function getElementValue(selector: string): string {
  const element = document.querySelector<HTMLInputElement>(selector);

  assertElementExists(element);

  return element.value;
}
```

As you can see, the compiler is telling us that there's a mistake: of course, this will only work if we wrap the code block within a condition, such as an `if` statement.

If we no longer want to proceed with the execution of a code block, we can use Typescript type assertions to throw an error and produce the side-effect. That means that if the assertion was positive, we can assume that the type is correct. 

This is particularly useful when a function is in the wrong state, or when validating input/output, which is something fairly common in server-side code (more than on the client-side).

## How to write a Typescript type assertion?

Assume you have a function that takes in input one or more parameters, we can assert the type of one of these by using the following syntax:

```typescript
function apiKeyExists(
  apiKey: string | undefined
): asserts apiKey is string {
  if (!apiKey) {
    throw new Error(`API key was not found`);
  }
}
```

If you omit the `asserts` keyword, it becomes a type guard.

Let's change the previous code by using an assertion, and handle the error using a `try/catch` statement.

```typescript
function assertElementExists(
  element: HTMLElement | null
): asserts element is HTMLElement {
  if (!element) {
    throw new Error(`Element was not found`);
  }
}

function getElementValue(selector: string): string {
  const element = document.querySelector<HTMLInputElement>(selector);

  assertElementExists(element);

  return element.value;
}

try {
  const value = getElementValue("#text");
  const result = document.querySelector<HTMLElement>("#textResult");

  assertElementExists(result);

  result.innerHTML = value;
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```

And now it works! 

Assertions allow us to write code that does not need to be wrapped into conditions for checking a type, or casted in any way. 

It doesn't mean we should use this instead of type guards in every situation.

Assertions shine when the execution should not continue: for example, when the input/output is invalid, or some critical requirement was not met within a code block.

It's also important to notice that we're throwing an error: the consumer has the responsibility to catch and handle it.
