title: Testing RxJS timers with Jest
live: true

---
Testing RxJS has always been a challenge for me, especially when using timers. Some testing utilities (such as Angular's) make it easier - others not so much.

Jest, though, didn't make me miss Angular's utilities much; I didn't find too much online, and StackOverflow's answers led to more questions. So this is for you, and the future me.

### Testing a simple timer stream with Jest's timers

Let's write a dead-simple RxJS operator which emits a value every 100 milliseconds. We will test that it emitted 5 times in 499 milliseconds, no more, and no less.

When we want to use Jest's timers, we need to enable such functionality:

```typescript
jest.useFakeTimers();
```

Let's create a simple function `tick` to advance by a certain number of ms:

```typescript
const tick = (ms = 0) => {  
	jest.advanceTimersByTime(ms);
};
```

By default, it advances by 0 milliseconds.

And now, on to the test.

We can use Jest's mock to count the times they have been called.

```typescript
// a simple mock

const fn = () => jest.fn(() => 1);
```

Now, nothing special, we will create the timer stream; it starts from 0 and advances every 100 milliseconds:

```typescript
const stream$ = timer(0, 100).pipe(
  tap(fn),
);
```

And here is the full test:

```typescript
it('emits 5 times', async () => {
  const fn = jest.fn(() => 1);
  const stream$ = timer(0, 100).pipe(tap(fn));

  // subscribe to the stream, otherwise it will never execute
  stream$.subscribe();

  // advance time by 499 ms
  tick(499);

  // expect the spy "fn" to have been called 5 times
  expect(fn.mock.calls.length).toEqual(5);
});
```

And here is proof :)
