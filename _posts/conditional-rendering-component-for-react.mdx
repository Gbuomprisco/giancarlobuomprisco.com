title: A conditional rendering Component for React

JSX allows a lot of freedom for what you can do in your components: at the end of the day, _it's just Javascript_.

If you're like me and you've primarily worked with template-based frameworks (such as Vue or Angular), you may be used to directives or components that take care of the flow: conditions, for-loops, switch, etc.

React doesn't have these baked in (like SolidJS), but we can easily add it.

This blog post will show you the conditional rendering component, which you can use with React, but it is also easily applicable to any other JSX-based library.

One challenge I faced was making sure the result of the condition was correctly cast so that we could safely use it with Typescript.

I'm calling the component `If`. It accepts two properties:

* `condition`: it's _any_ value. If it is truthy, then `children` will be displayed
* `fallback`: it's optional and will be displayed if it's defined, and if it's the condition is `falsy`

Of course, it also accepts a `children` property, which we augment to take a function. Why? Because we want to pass the "casted" value to the children's tree.

For example, if I pass a component `Button` as a condition, I want to be able to use `Button` within the tree because it is not `falsy`. To do so, `Button` will be passed down casted as a parameter of the function we define in the `children`.

```tsx
function If<Value = unknown>({
  condition,
  fallback,
  children,
}: React.PropsWithChildren<{
  condition: Condition<Value>;
  fallback?: ReactNode;
  children: ReactNode | ((value: Value) => ReactNode);
}>) {
   // body
}
```

I'm defining two type aliases with Typescript:

* `Falsy` which represent values that are falsy in Javascript
* `Condition` which is the value passed to the component

```tsx
type Falsy = undefined | null | 0 | "";
type Condition<Value = unknown> = Value | Falsy;
```

We can now write the body:

* if `condition` is truthy, we can render the `children`. If it's a function, then we call it and passed the result of the condition down as a parameter
* if `condition` is falsy, and the `fallback` property is defined, we render `fallback`
* otherwise, we return `null` so that nothing gets rendered

```tsx
return useMemo(() => {
  if (condition) {
    if (typeof children === "function") {
      return <>{children(condition)}</>;
    }

    return <>{children}</>;
  }

  if (fallback) {
    return <>{fallback}</>;
  }

  return null;
}, [condition, fallback, children]);
```

And here is the complete snippet:

```tsx
type Falsy = undefined | null | 0 | "";
type Condition<Value = unknown> = Value | Falsy;

function If<Value = unknown>({
  condition,
  children,
  fallback
}: React.PropsWithChildren<{
  condition: Condition<Value>;
  children: ReactNode | ((value: Value) => ReactNode);
  fallback?: ReactNode;
}>) {
  return useMemo(() => {
    if (condition) {
      if (typeof children === "function") {
        return <>{children(condition)}</>;
      }

      return <>{children}</>;
    }

    if (fallback) {
      return <>{fallback}</>;
    }

    return null;
  }, [condition, fallback, children]);
}
```
### Example

Let's see a quick example that shows how to use the `If` component:

```tsx
function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<number>(0);

  const onChange = (e: FormEvent<HTMLInputElement>) =>
    setValue(Number(e.currentTarget.value));

  const fallback = <span>Fallback content</span>;

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <div>
        <input value={value} type="number" onChange={onChange} />
      </div>

      <If condition={value} fallback={fallback}>
        Value: {value}
      </If>
    </div>
  );
}
```
