In order to create the configuration file, we can use various file formats such as <em>JSON</em>, <em>JS</em>, <em>YAML</em> or <em>TOML</em> — but I like <em>YAML</em>, so go ahead and create a file in your root (i.e. where your <em>package.json</em> is located) and name it <em>.prettierrc. </em></p><p>Here is a simple <em>.prettierrc</em> file with options I tend to use:</p><div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">tabWidth</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">4</span>

It’s not, so let’s simplify this for your team.</p><p>You have 3 options:</p><ul><li>create a <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fprettier.io%2Fdocs%2Fen%2Fprecommit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-commit hook</a> as described on Prettier’s website</li><li>set up your IDE (if you use WebStorm <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fprettier.io%2Fdocs%2Fen%2Fwebstorm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use a watcher</a>, or if you use VSCode <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fprettier.io%2Fdocs%2Fen%2Feditors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use a plugin</a>)</li><li>… something even better, use both! It’s a great feeling for a developer to have the feeling of always committing something correct, but also to have instant feedback of a clean, formatted file.</li></ul><h3>Takeaways ⭐️</h3><ul><li>DX

This is needed in order to make Prettier and TsLint work nicely together.\n\nAfter that — it’s time to setup Prettier. In order to create the configuration file, we can use various file formats such as _JSON_, _JS_, _YAML_ or _TOML_ — but I like _YAML_, so go ahead and create a file in your root (i.e. where your _package.json_ is located) and name it _.prettierrc. _\n\nHere is a simple _.prettierrc_ file with options I tend to use:\n\n```yaml\ntabWidth: 4\nsingleQuote: _true\n_bracketSpacing: _true\n_printWidth: 80\n```\n\nFor the list of all the available options, head to [Prettier’s website](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fprettier.io%2Fdocs%2Fen%2Foptions.html).\n\nThis is great, but how exactly is this simple? It’s not, so let’s simplify this for your team.\n\nYou have 3 options:\n\n*   create a [pre-commit hook](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fprettier.io%2Fdocs%2Fen%2Fprecommit.html) as described on Prettier’s website\n*   set up your IDE (if you use WebStorm [use a watcher](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fprettier.io%2Fdocs%2Fen%2Fwebstorm.html), or if you use VSCode [use a plugin](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fprettier.io%2Fdocs%2Fen%2Feditors.html))\n*   … something even better, use both! It’s a great feeling for a developer to have the feeling of always committing something correct, but also to have instant feedback of a clean, formatted file.\n\n### Takeaways ⭐️\n\n*   DX is important — make sure your team is happy\n*   Coding style is important — make sure your whole team agrees with it\n*   Use Prettier and TsLint (or EsLint) for working better and faster\n"},"content":{"compiledSource":"var c=Object.defineProperty,d=Object.defineProperties;var u=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors;var s=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols;var i=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,r=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var p=(t,a,n)=\u003ea in t?c(t,a,{enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0,value:n}):t[a]=n,e=(t,a)=\u003e{for(var n in a||(a={}))i.call(a,n)\u0026\u0026p(t,n,a[n]);if(s)for(var n of s(a))r.call(a,n)\u0026\u0026p(t,n,a[n]);return t},l=(t,a)=\u003ed(t,u(a));var m=(t,a)=\u003e{var n={};for(var o in t)i.call(t,o)\u0026\u0026a.indexOf(o)\u003c0\u0026\u0026(n[o]=t[o]);if(t!=null\u0026\u0026s)for(var o of s(t))a.indexOf(o)\u003c0\u0026\u0026r.call(t,o)\u0026\u0026(n[o]=t[o]);return n};const layoutProps={},MDXLayout=\"wrapper\";function MDXContent(n){var o=n,{components:t}=o,a=m(o,[\"components\"]);return mdx(MDXLayout,l(e(e({},layoutProps),a),{components:t,mdxType:\"MDXLayout\"}),mdx(\"p\",null,\"A project\\u2019s coding style is the first and most noticeable trait that a new senior hire will be looking at while browsing the codebase for the first time.\\xA0\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"On the surface, that\\u2019s because it is probably the simplest way to evaluate a codebase at a glance.
