Abby and I spent these Christmas holidays in Rome for the first time.

It's been an incredibly crappy year, mainly due to our visa statuses which
makes it hard to live together, and the misery of the Italian bureaucracy,
legal system, and the evil PA administrators in my village who
prevented us from forming a civil partnership (which according to both
European and Italian law is 100% lawful).

So, yes, **we really did need a break**.

It hasn't gone exactly as planned: my brother and his wife got sick
(thankfully it was a simple cold), but didn't allow us to spend as much tim
together as we wanted to. And my other brother's wife too.

With that said, we tried to make the bs of it.
